Here is a project I designed with my group mates in my year2 study, which is about a VGA game based on FPGA.
User should prepair DE2 or DE1 Altera FPGA board, and Quartus 18.01.
The rule of the game is that player need to remote the FPGA board to control Mario to push the box.
1.Reset sw0
2.Star  sw1
3.Direction control  Key0~3
